# PokeTools
## What is it?
PokeTools is a set of tools for managing Pokemon saves. It is being developed by OutRite, also known as usless534.    
## What can it do currently?
It currently only supports generation one (Red, Blue) and generation one and a half (Yellow), and likely doesn't work on the Japanese games (I don't have a copy, so I can't test. Open an issue if it doesn't.)    
It allows for fixing broken saves (though it'll likely be very glitchy / not have a continue button)    
It can also let you change your trainers name while keeping the same information, though it doesn't yet have support for numbers or special characters.    
And, the feature that took me the most time? The save corruptor that half the time just makes the game ignore it.    
## Why did you make it?
I like messing with saves. I also like messing with checksums. Combine them, and you get a ~~waste of time~~ decent Pokemon save resource
## What can I do?
Currently, either make my code better, or test my code on a Japanese copy of the game (one you got legitimately).    
Also I might make some videos about this on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCHVD9PkkOcZXw7_XeVZWYw) so you can support me by just putting these in the background
