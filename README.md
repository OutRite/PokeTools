# PokeTools
## What is it?
PokeTools is a set of tools for managing Pokemon saves. It is being developed by OutRite, also known as usless534.    
## What can it do currently?
It currently only supports generation one (Red, Blue) and likely doesn't work on Green (I don't have a copy, so I can't test. Open an issue if it doesn't.)    
It allows for fixing broken saves (though it'll likely be very glitchy / not have a continue button)    
It can also let you change your trainers name while keeping the same information, though it doesn't yet have support for numbers or special characters.    
## Why did you make it?
I like messing with saves. I also like messing with checksums. Combine them, and you get a ~~waste of time~~
